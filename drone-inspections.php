                            Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are finding applications in an increasing number
                            of industries. Intertek has added the use of drone and robotics to create an inspection
                            program capable of acquiring data that would eliminate working in hazardous locations
                            (flare tip, at height, rope access, confined space, offshore under platform, etc.) and
                            costly additions such as scaffolds, manlifts, downtime, and personnel hours.

                            Thanks to the data collected by drones, key energy stakeholders now have more actionable
                            insights into energy-generating equipment, projects, and operations, empowering them to
                            make smarter decisions.
